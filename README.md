# BlackJack
Blackjack game I created for a Per Scholas project

Motivation:
I really enjoy going to the casino. One of my favorite games is BlackJack, which inspired me to create my own

How the game works:
BlackJack is a card game where you are trying to get as close as you can to 21 without going over, while also scoring higher than the dealer. 
each card is worth a certain value 2's are worth 2 points, 3's are worth 3 points and so on, until you get to the face cards. 
Jacks, Queens and Kings are all worth 10 points. Aces are worth 11 or 1, whichever value you need it to be.
You are dealt 2 cards face up and the dealer is dealt 1 card face up and 1 face down. If you think you can get closer to 21 without going over you hit, which means 
the dealer gives you another card. If you go over 21 you bust and automatically lose that hand. If you are under 21 you can either hit again or stay. After you stay the dealer must hit until they are at 17 or above,
if the dealer doesnt bust you compare points, closest to 21 wins.

Code languages:
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project



How to play the game:
When the page loads you are automatically dealt 2 cards and so is the dealer. if you want to hit you press the hit button, which deals you another card.
When you are satisfied with your points press stand and the dealer will hit if nessecary. You must hit stand until a winner is declared, then hit new game.
When you hit new game you must hit deal. This will start the game all over again. Each time you win it adds a point to your score. 
Whoever has the most points when the deck is empty wins!
